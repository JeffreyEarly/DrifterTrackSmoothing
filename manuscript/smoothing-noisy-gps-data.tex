\section{B-Splines}
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A B-spline, or basis spline, of order $K$ is a piecewise polynomial function defined with respect to knot points. The terminology here is confusing, but generally seems to be that a B-spline of \emph{order} $K$, is a piecewise polynomial of \emph{degree} $S=K-1$. That means that a $4$th order B-spline is a piecewise cubic polynomial. The \emph{knot points} define the location where the polynomials meet. Continuity is maintained to as high of order as possible. So a $K=1$ B-spline is a piecewise constant function with value $1$ between two knot points, while $K=2$ B-spline forms a continuous triangle function with a piecewise constant first derivative (see figure \ref{bsplines}).
